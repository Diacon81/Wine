WINES DATA. EXPLORATION AND ANALYSIS

- Description:
This project involves a comprehensive exploration of a world of wines dataset using Python libraries. The dataset includes information about the wine's origin, score, price, tasters' notes, and other general information about each wine.

- Dataset source at https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews: 
●	winemag-data_first150k.csv
●	winemag-data-130k-v2.json

- Requirements:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
NumPy
Seaborn

- Execution Instructions:
Open the Jupyter Notebook.
Run each cell in sequential order.
Ensure the required libraries are installed.

- Project Structure:
wines.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.

- Record of Incidents:
● Learnings: creating Pandas Dataframes, Filtering Dataframe Values, Managing NaN Values and Bad Data, Statistical Analysis and Data Aggregation, and, Exporting Results into CSV and json Files.

● Conclusions: proper data handling is fundamental, as when dealing with real-world data, it's common to encounter null values, incorrect, or unusual information. This ensures or approximates an optimal result for analysis and decision-making; the reliability of conclusions relies on the quality and proper handling of the data.

● Challenges: data quality.
